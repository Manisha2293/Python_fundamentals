Question 1: By using a single 'print' function print the provided string in specified execution format.
            Hello World
            Welcome to 'Python' Programming

Answer: 
print("Hello World\nWelcome to 'Python' Programming")
Output:
Hello World
Welcome to 'Python' Programming


Question 2: Design a Python program which can calculate the area by taking radius as input by 'user input' method.
            instead of giving direct values try using "float(input())"

Answer: 
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
o/p: Enter the radius of the circle:  5
area = 3.14 * radius**2
print(area)
o/p: 78.5


Question 3: Write a python program which can take your first and last name seperately and execute as shown below.
            Sample execution : Hello 'first name' 'last name', hope you are doing good
Answer:
frstname= str(input("Enter first name"))
o/p: Enter first name manisha
lastname= str(input("Enter last name"))
o/p: Enter last name Agrawal
print(f"Hello {frstname} {lastname}, hope you are doing good")
o/p: Hello manisha Agrawal, hope you are doing good

Question 4: Write a python program which can convert kilograms to grams.

Answer: 
kg = float(input("Enter weight in kilograms: "))
o/p: Enter weight in kilograms:  10
g= kg * 1000
print(g)
o/p: 10000.0

Question 5: Write a python program which can calculate the electricity bill by considering the no. of units consumed and other parameters are mentioned below.
            If units consumed is less than 50 then bill amount should be 100INR.
            If units consumed between 50 - 300 then each unit will be charged at 4.5 INR.
            If units are consumed more than 300 then that billed individual have to pay base pay as 1000INR and 300 units will be reduced from his total consumed units and
              for remaining units 7 INR will be charged for each unit.
Answer:
e_bill = float(input("Enter no. of units consumed"))
o/p: Enter no. of units consumed 200.5
if e_bill<50:
    print("100INR")
elif e_bill>=50 and e_bill<=300:
    print(e_bill*4.5)
else:
    print(1000+(e_bill-300)*7)
o/p:902.25


Question 6:Write a program to check if the input is positive or negative.

Answer: 
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
o/p: Enter a number:  5.87
if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
o/p:
The number is positive.


Question 7: Define a function which can identify if a user has entered specific string or not.
            specified string = "India"

Answer:
def check_str(user_input):
    specified_string = "India"
    if specified_string==user_input:
        return("user has input specified string")
    else:
        return("user has not input specified string")
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")
o/p: Enter a string:  India
result=check_str(user_input)
print(result)
o/p: user has input specified string


Question 8:  Define a function which will greet by taking user name as input.
            input = name
            hello 'name', hope you are doing well

Answer: 
def greet():
    name=input("Enter name: ")
    print(f"hello {name}, hope you are doing well")
greet()
o/p: 
Enter name:  manisha
hello manisha, hope you are doing well


Question 9: Check if a given string is palindrome.
            A string is palindrome if the reverse of the string is same as itself.
            For eg. madam
            Print " `string` is palindrome" if it is palindrome
            else " `string` is not a palindrome" if it is not a palindrome.
            
            Hint : Use slicing to get reverse of the string.

Answer:
user_input=str(input("Enter a string:"))
o/p: Enter a string: madam
reversed_string = user_input[::-1]
def palindrome():
    if user_input==reversed_string:
        print(f"{user_input} is palindrome")
    else:
        print(f"{user_input} is not a palindrome")
palindrome()
o/p: madam is palindrome


Question 10: Write a python program to find n is a leap year.
            Print "n is a leap year" if the given year is leap year.
            Print "n is not a leap year" if the given year is not leap year.
            Replace n with given year.
            
            Hint : Use nested if-else

Answer:
year=int(input("Enter a number to check for leap year:"))
o/p: Enter a number to check for leap year: 2026
def leap_yr(user_input):
    if (year % 4 == 0):
        if (year % 100 == 0):
            if (year % 400 == 0):
                print(f"{year} is a leap year")
            else:
                print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year")
leap_yr(year)
o/p: 2026 is not a leap year
